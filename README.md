### Languages Used.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

  - HTML5 was used to create the content and base of each page.

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

  - CSS3 was used to then style the page and make it responsive through media queries, and interactive through using CSS transitions.

- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

  - I used bootstrap throughout the site to make it responsive. I also used bootstrap to create the booking forms, and the modals pop up when the forms have been submitted.
